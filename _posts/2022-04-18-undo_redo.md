TODO: previous approach = copy-on-write data-structure for layers that is copied after every modification

TODO: nice and simple for compicated operations like the simulation steps => heavy overkill for simple things like changing the elevation of a single vertex

TODO: Command-Pattern

TODO: Combination of COW-structure and commands => new undo/redo system

TODO: plan for new timeline view
