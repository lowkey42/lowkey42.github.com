TOOD: intro => movement causes self-intersections and other artefacts => need to be cleaned up in each iteration

TODO: interaction with simulation data in layers => defined by their definition (good enough for now, but might need extension later on)

<!--more-->

## 1. Refinement
TODO: some areas are more interesting than other + model allows for variing level-of-detail => increase/decrease resolution by adding/removing vertices (currently pretty simple; room for much more improvements, both results and performance)


## 3. Create new oceanic crust at divergent boundaries
TODO: plates move apart => add new sub-plate when distance>X

TODO: how are elevations and crust type determined (note: placeholder => correct approach would be to simulate vulcanism to create continental crust => extension for later)


## 7. Find and resolve collisions
TODO: self-intersections = collisions => subduction => collapse edges to solve

TODO: error case (low liklyhood but can happen if timestep is too large or movement too fast or chaotic)


## 8. Restore Delaunay condition

TODO: description of Delaunay condition (what is it and why is it important to us) => how its checked => how its restored (rotate + additional conditions to avoid artifacts)

TODO: finding and fixing degenerated triangles. e.g. triangles that are extremly thin or have an extremly small height (=> vertices are nearly colliding) => re-check delaunay condition


## Conclusion
Next => large-scale interaction (splitting/mergin) of plates
