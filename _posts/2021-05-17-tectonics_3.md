TODO

1. Refinement
3. spawn new plates on ridge-boundaries
7. Check if there accoured collisions between plates during movement and resolve them
8. Restore Delaunay condition
9. Fix degenerated triangles. e.g. triangles that are extremly thin or have an extremly small height (=> vertices are nearly colliding)
10. Restore Delaunay condition (again)


# Conclusion
Next => large-scale interaction (splitting/mergin) of plates
