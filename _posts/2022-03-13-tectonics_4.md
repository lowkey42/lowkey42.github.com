TOOD: intro => movement causes self-intersections and other artefacts => need to be cleaned up in each iteration

<!--more-->

## 1. Refinement
TODO: some areas are more interesting than other + model allows for variing level-of-detail => increase/decrease resolution by adding/removing vertices

## 3. Create new oceanic crust at divergent boundaries
TODO: plates move apart => add new sub-plate when distance>X

TODO: how are elevations and crust type determined

## 7. Find and resolve collisions
TODO: self-intersections = collisions => subduction => collapse edges to solve

TODO: error case

## 8. Restore Delaunay condition
TODO: description of Delaunay condition => how its checked => how its restored

TODO: possiblities for future improvemnts

TODO: finding and fixing degenerated triangles. e.g. triangles that are extremly thin or have an extremly small height (=> vertices are nearly colliding) => re-check delaunay condition


## Conclusion
Next => large-scale interaction (splitting/mergin) of plates
