TOOD: intro: last post about movement; previously: elevation change and subduction => now high-level interactions => suturing and rifting => Step 10

<!--more-->

## Suturing

TODO: when, how, possible improvements

## Rifting

TODO: when, how, possible improvements


## Conclusion

TODO: analysis of results => prove of concept yes/no?

TODO: applyed some improvements, found writing these posts

TODO: future developments
- Improve Refinement step, more resultion where its need and less where its not (new layer that contains information about how active (interesting) a given zone is)
- Test if the originaly planed elevation calculation based on area-changes of sub-plates and isostatic equilibrium works/would be an improvement, now that all small kinks in the simulation are worked out
- Improved curst formation by simulating vulcansim at subduction zones, rifts and (maybe later) Hot-Spots (e.g. Hawaii)
- Improve meta-plate interactions => more interesting rifting (maybe using vulcanism)
- Detail generation (based on paper)
- Much later: Climate and hydrology simulation => rivers + better erosion
- Required for that => Better Tooling/Editor (already mostly done)
