TOOD: intro: last post movement, elevation change and subduction => now high-level interactions => suturing and rifting => Step 10

<!--more-->

## Suturing

TODO: when, how, possible improvements

## Rifting

TODO: when, how, possible improvements


## Conclusion

TODO: analysis of results => prove of concept yes/no?

TODO: future developments
- Detail generation (based on paper)
- Hot-Spots (e.g. Hawaii)
- Climate and hydrology simulation => rivers + better erosion
- First: applying some of the improvements found writing these posts + trying to solve some of the problems
- Required for that => Better Tooling/Editor (already on-going)
