TODO: this post: differences to paper, used model and outline of algorithm steps


<!--more-->

TODO: main differences:
- How plates are modeled: polygons vs. sets of interconnected points
- How collision boundaries are handled: instantanious vs. simulated over time
- Simulation of movement: no information in paper => infinitly small points with constant mass for sub-plates + verlet integration


# Model

TODO: delaunay triangulation; vertices = sub-plates; each vertex with its own elevation, type and velocity, but belonging to a meta-plate, identified by an id; through triangulation each vertex is connected to its closest neighbors

TODO: Simulation: similar to spring-damper-modell
- each vertex is an infinitly small point-mass
- edges between vertices apply forces to their origin and destination; types of forces depend on id, type and velocity of the two affected vertices
    - e.g. two vertices belonging to the same plate have a damped spring that determines the applied force between them, to keep the distance close to the initial one
    - can be visualized as interconnected springs stretched over a sphere
- collisions are handled through:
    - detection of invalid triangles, e.g. inverted triangles => removal
	- calculation of separating velocity => subduction, rifting or collision boundary => modify elevation
- since vertices are constantly in motion
    - delaunay condition needs to be restored after every update
    - new vertices are inserted at oceanic ridges
    - edges are split collapsed to keep the mesh within therten parameters (max vertex density)

# Simulation

TODO: general idea

TODO:
Steps:
1. Refinement
2. identify type of boundaries between sub-plates => remember in edge-layer
3. spawn new plates on ridge-boundaries
4. Calculate forces acting on plates
5. Simulate plate movement: Update plate velocity and move them (re-normalize to plate surface)
6. Update elevation at subduction and collision boundaries
7. Check if there accoured collisions between plates during movement and resolve them
8. Restore Delaunay condition
9. Fix degenerated triangles. e.g. triangles that are extremly thin or have an extremly small height (=> vertices are nearly colliding)
10. Restore Delaunay condition (again)
11. Apply simple erosion
12. Split/Combine plates


# Conclusion
Next => Initial State
