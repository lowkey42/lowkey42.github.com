I"Q<p>As the end of my studies in nigh, I’m looking into possible topics for my master thesis. Alas, I’ve grown a bit tired of writing game engines and renderers lately – who’d have thought.</p>

<p>Luckily, this quest for new <del>shores</del> topics was solved quickly. I’ve also developed quite an interest in procedural generation and always had a bit of a fascination for fantasy worlds and maps. So, I’ve decided to work on procedural world generation.</p>

<p>This is obviously going to be a <a href="https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php?title=DF2014:Fun&amp;redirect=no">fun</a> project with much potential for interesting failures.<sup class="footnote" onclick="showFootnote(this)" title="But as Gordon Moore put it: If everything you try works, you aren't trying hard enough." data-title="But as Gordon Moore put it: If everything you try works, you aren't trying hard enough.">[1]</sup> Therefore, I have the best intentions of documenting my plans, progress and interesting problems here. With best intentions I do of course mean “force myself” and with documenting I mean “dumb my thoughts here and try to make sense of it all here”.</p>

<p>Without further ado: Welcome to this unwise cocktail of a <a href="https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2020/02/the-forever-project.html">forever project</a> and a master thesis.</p>
