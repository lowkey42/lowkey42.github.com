<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
<p>Directly adding faces is not part of the original paper, nor any implementations I could find but I really wanted to allow this for ease of use. The problem is, that this is not as trivial as it may seem at first because triangles might be added in (nearly) any order and we need to update the connectivity informations correctly for all possible cases.</p>

  <figcaption>Forbidden case: The central vertex is already used by two faces, that are not connected by another face. When we want to add a new face that is not connected to one of the existing faces, we can't decide if it should be inserted at the top (A) or bottom (B).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>TODO: restriction</p>
<ul>
  <li>If multiple unconnected faces share a vertex, a new face can only be added to that vertex, if it shares an edge with one of the faces. This guarentees that the order of the edges around a vertex is always well defined. This ambiguity could<sup class="footnote" onclick="showFootnote(this)" title="and normal is">[1]</sup> also be resolved by comparing the positions of the connected vertices. But with this small restriction we by use the possibility to ignore the vertex positions completly here and look at on the topology only in terms of which vertices/faces are connect without knowing how they will be layed out in space.</li>
</ul>

<p>In light of all requirements and limitations, there are a total of 21 cases. Most of which (13) are caused by the shared-vertex-problem and can be ignored for now. The rest consist of two simple cases (zero/three new edges) and the to more complex cases for one/two new edges with 3 cases each.</p>

<p>TODO: image</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>No new edges:</b> Not an obvious case, but happens if a hole in a mesh is filled in.
What we do: (almost) nothing. All edges are already there and should be connected correctly. So we just need to update the origin face of the outgoing dual edges and are done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>One new edge:</b> TODO</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Two new edgee:</b> TODO</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Three new edges:</b> The other simple case. We just added a triangle that is not connected to anything else.
What we do: Create the three quad-edges, connect each of the primal edges around the three vertices and connect the dual edges into two loops</p>
  </li>
</ul>
