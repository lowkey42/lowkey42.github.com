    <p>Hi! My name is Florian Oetke. Iâ€™m a C++ programmer with a passion for engine architecture and game design. Currently, I am a CS student at Trier University of Applied Sciences.</p>

    <p>My professional experience lies in enterprise application development (mostly search-engines and document analysis with JavaEE). I also dabbled a bit in game design but my main interest is game/engine/graphics programming and C++ in general.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™ve worked on a couple of small to medium sized games as part of my semester/hobby/GameJam projects. Some of the more interesting ones Iâ€™ve listed <a href="/portfolio">here</a>. My biggest private project to date probably is my pet-engine <a href="/portfolio#mirrage">Mirrage</a>. Iâ€™ve started this project as a way to wrap my head around the Vulkan API. Over time â€“ and (mostly) through my <a href="/ssgi_thesis.pdf">Bachelorâ€™s thesis</a> â€“ it evolved into an actual renderer. Ever since, it has grown through some semester and GameJam projects into a semi-usable game engine.</p>

    <p>Fueled by some of my work in graphics programming and a passion for RPGs, Iâ€™ve also developed an interest in procedural content generation. The most interesting aspect to me is the potential of game world generation and interactive generation/adaption of stories. This let me to my newest playground-project <a href="/portfolio#yggdrasill">Yggdrasill</a>. This project is still in a pretty early stage, but my goal is to create a framework that can be used generate realistic world-maps based on physical simulations and artistic input.</p>

    <p>If you would like to get in touch just send me an <a href="mailto:info@second-system.de">e-mail</a>, contact me through <a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Florian_Oetke" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xing</a> or have a look at my projects on <a href="https://gitlab.com/lowkey42" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitLab</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lowkey42" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>
