<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YGDL_Vertex</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YGDL_Face</code> are just a struct around an integer id (type-safety). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YGDL_Edge</code> also contains just an integer but its value is a bit more complex since each edge needs to known which other edges are part of its quad-edge. Because the edges are stored continously and we always create two primal and two dual edges, finding the opposite (sym) of an edge is as simple as flipping its least-significant bit. But we also need to store if the edge is part of the primal or the dual array. For that we steal the most-significant bit (1=dual).</p>

<p>So we don‚Äôt have to store any addition indices to implement the three basic traversal functions sym/rot/inv_rot but just need some simple bit operations.</p>

<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
<p>Directly adding faces is not part of the original paper, nor any implementations I could find but I really wanted to allow this for ease of use. The problem is, that this is not as trivial as it may seem at first because triangles might be added in (nearly) any order and we need to update the connectivity informations correctly for all possible cases.</p>

<p>In light of all requirements and limitations, there are a total of 21 cases. Most of which (13) are caused by the shared-vertex-problem and can be ignored for now. The rest consist of two simple cases (zero/three new edges) and the to more complex cases for one/two new edges with 3 cases each.</p>

<p>TODO: image</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>No new edges:</b> Not an obvious case, but happens if a hole in a mesh is filled in.
What we do: (almost) nothing. All edges are already there and should be connected correctly. So we just need to update the origin face of the outgoing dual edges and are done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>One new edge:</b> TODO</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Two new edgee:</b> TODO</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Three new edges:</b> The other simple case. We just added a triangle that is not connected to anything else.
What we do: Create the three quad-edges, connect each of the primal edges around the three vertices and connect the dual edges into two loops</p>
  </li>
</ul>
