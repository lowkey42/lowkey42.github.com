<p>TODO: analysis of results =&gt; prove of concept yes/no?</p>

<p>TODO: applyed some improvements, found writing these posts</p>

<p>TODO: future developments</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve Refinement step, more resultion where its need and less where its not (new layer that contains information about how active (interesting) a given zone is)</li>
  <li>Test if the originaly planed elevation calculation based on area-changes of sub-plates and isostatic equilibrium works/would be an improvement, now that all small kinks in the simulation are worked out</li>
  <li>Improved curst formation by simulating vulcansim at subduction zones, rifts and (maybe later) Hot-Spots (e.g. Hawaii)</li>
  <li>Improve meta-plate interactions =&gt; more interesting rifting (maybe using vulcanism)</li>
  <li>Detail generation (based on paper)</li>
  <li>Much later: Climate and hydrology simulation =&gt; rivers + better erosion</li>
  <li>Required for that =&gt; Better Tooling/Editor (already mostly done)</li>
</ul>
