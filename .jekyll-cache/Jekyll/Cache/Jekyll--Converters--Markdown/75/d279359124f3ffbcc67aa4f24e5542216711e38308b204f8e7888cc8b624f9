I"´<p>Iâ€™m currently looking into possible topics for my master thesis. But against all odds Iâ€™ve grown a bit tired of writing game engines and renderers, lately. So, seeing as Iâ€™ve also developed an interest in procedural generation and always had a bit of a fascination for fantasy worlds and maps, Iâ€™ve decided to work on procedural world generation. This is obviously going to be a <a href="https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php?title=DF2014:Fun&amp;redirect=no">fun</a> project with much potential for interesting failures. But as Gordon Moore put it: If everything you try works, you arenâ€™t trying hard enough. Therefore, Iâ€™m planing to force my self to document my plans, progress and interesting problems here (even if primarily for myself).</p>

<p>So without further ado: Welcome to this unwise mix of <a href="https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2020/02/the-forever-project.html">forever project</a> and master thesis.</p>
