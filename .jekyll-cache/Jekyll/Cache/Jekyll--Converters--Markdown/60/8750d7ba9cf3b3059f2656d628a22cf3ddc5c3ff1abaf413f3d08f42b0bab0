I"0<p>As the end of my studies in nigh, I’m looking into possible topics for my master thesis. Alas, I’ve grown a bit tired of writing game engines and renderers lately – who’d have thought. So, seeing as I’ve also developed an interest in procedural generation and always had a bit of a fascination for fantasy worlds and maps, I’ve decided to work on procedural world generation. This is obviously going to be a <a href="https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php?title=DF2014:Fun&amp;redirect=no">fun</a> project with much potential for interesting failures.<sup class="footnote" onclick="showFootnote(this)" title="But as Gordon Moore put it: If everything you try works, you aren't trying hard enough.">[1]</sup> Therefore, I’m planing to force my self to document my plans, progress and interesting problems here (though primarily as a means of organizing my thoughts).</p>

<p>So without further ado: Welcome to this unwise mix of <a href="https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2020/02/the-forever-project.html">forever project</a> and master thesis.</p>
