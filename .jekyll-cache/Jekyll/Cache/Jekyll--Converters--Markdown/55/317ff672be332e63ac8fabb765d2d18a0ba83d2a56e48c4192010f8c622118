<p>Well, that was a bit of a longer pause, than I had hoped. So much for my ‚Äúbest intentions of documenting my progress‚Äù‚Ä¶</p>

<p>But I‚Äôve finally managed to implement a working prove-of-concept for the plate simulation to generate terrain, also it‚Äôs still a bit rough around the edges.</p>

<p>While there are still many problems that need more work<sup class="footnote" onclick="showFootnote(this)" title="i.a. continents loosing too much area during collisions, missing details on coastlines and oceanic ridges, no shallow/continental-plate oceans, weird looking elongates plates and unnatural looking splitting of large plates ">[1]</sup> the general approach seems to work.</p>

<p>But one thing that I notice now is, that the current tooling to visualize the results is not enough to test and debug the algorithm. So, before I continue working on the algorithm itself, I‚Äôve decided to refactor and improve the editor to better visualize the generated data and allow users to modify the intermediary results. But first, it‚Äôs probably a good idea to document how the current implementation of the plate simulation works<sup class="footnote" onclick="showFootnote(this)" title="before I forget how it works and would have to wrangle that knowledge from the code itself... ">[2]</sup>.</p>
