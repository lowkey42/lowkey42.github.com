Hey! My name is Florian Oetke. I'm a C++ programmer with a passion for engine architecture and game design and a CS student at Trier University of Applied Sciences.

My professional experience lies in enterprise application development (mostly search-engines and document analysis with JavaEE) and I dabbled a bit in game design but my main interest is game/engine/graphics programming and C++ in general.

I've worked on a couple of small to medium sized games as part of my semester/hobby/GameJam projects, some of which I've listed <a href="/portfolio">here</a>. The biggest of these is probably my pet-engine <a href="/portfolio#mirrage">Mirrage</a>, which started as a way to wrap my head around the Vulkan API, evolved through my <a href="/ssgi_thesis.pdf">Bachelor thesis</a> into an actual renderer and has grown ever since through some semester and Game Jam projects into a semi-usable game engine.

Fueled by some of my work in graphics programming and passion for RPGs, I've developed an interest in procedural generation in general and the generation of game worlds and stories in particular, leading to my newest playground-project <a href="/portfolio#yggdrasill">Yggdrasill</a> in which I'm going to try to generate realistic world-maps based on physical simulations and artistic input.



If you would like to get in touch just send me an <a href="mailto:info@second-system.de">e-mail</a> or contact me through <a href="http://www.xing.com/profile/Florian_Oetke" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xing</a> or have a look at my projects on <a href="https://gitlab.com/lowkey42" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitLab</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lowkey42" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.
